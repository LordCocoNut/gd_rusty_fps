# gd_rusty_fps
FPS library for gdnative written in Rust.

This projects aims to create easy to use .dll library to be used with godot engine for FPS game development.

<hr>
We have to provide these features:

- camera look controller -> basic component is done
- player body walking with slopes etc fixes -> basic component is done, requires jumping that will be implemented later on
- game hud stuff
- world interactor
- basic interactible items to allow creation of quests etc without using this library

-> this library should then be used to create a simple horror adventure game for demonstration.
